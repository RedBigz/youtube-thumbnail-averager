This script downloads thumbnails from YT channels (or playlists if you want) and blends them into one image.

Requirements for those who don't feel like looking at the req file
> Python 3.x
> yt-dlp
> Pillow
> NumPy
> requests

How to use
> 1. Go to a youtube thumbnail grabber website (i use YTlarge) and get the id of the channel you wanna blend. the id is the part that starts with UC.
> 2. Run the script i guess
